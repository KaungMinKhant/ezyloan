### **Flow**:
1. **Loan Status Tracking**:
   - Borrowers and lenders monitor the current status of loans:
     - Active, Repaid, or Defaulted.
     - Loan balance, remaining repayment amount, and due dates.

2. **Collateral Value Tracking**:
   - Borrowers and lenders keep an eye on the real-time value of collateral (crypto or tokenized assets).
   - Alerts are generated if collateral value drops below the required Loan-to-Value (LTV) threshold.

3. **Interest Accrual**:
   - The system calculates interest dynamically and updates the total repayment amount accordingly.
   - Borrowers see the breakdown of principal and interest in real-time.

4. **Repayment Schedules**:
   - Borrowers view their repayment timeline and due dates.
   - Lenders track repayment inflows and expected returns.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Borrowers are notified about:
     - Upcoming repayment deadlines.
     - Changes in collateral value (e.g., liquidation warnings).
   - Lenders receive updates on repayments or collateral status.

### **Integrations**

#### **1. 1inch Portfolio API: Loan and Collateral Tracking**
- **Purpose**:
  - Provide real-time insights into borrowers’ and lenders’ loan-related portfolios.
  - Track the value of collateral and loan performance dynamically.

- **How It Works**:
  - The Portfolio API fetches:
    - Current wallet balances.
    - Asset values for collateral tracking.
    - Loan-related transactions, such as repayments and interest payments.

- **Implementation**:
  - Fetch portfolio data using 1inch API:
    ```javascript
    const portfolio = await fetch(
      `https://api.1inch.io/v4.0/1/portfolio?wallet=${walletAddress}`
    );
    console.log("Portfolio Details:", portfolio);
    ```

- **Use Case**:
  - A borrower sees their collateral value updated in real time (e.g., ETH value changes from $1,800 to $1,750).
  - A lender monitors their portfolio to track interest earned and repayments received.

#### **2. Chainlink Automation (Keepers): Automated Loan Management**
- **Purpose**:
  - Automate key actions related to loan management, such as:
    - Updating loan status (e.g., marking it as "Repaid").
    - Sending repayment reminders to borrowers.
    - Initiating collateral liquidation if necessary.

- **How It Works**:
  - Chainlink Keepers monitor smart contract conditions and execute pre-defined actions when those conditions are met.
  - Example: If a repayment is due in 3 days, Keepers trigger a notification.

- **Implementation**:
  - Example of a smart contract with Chainlink Keepers:
    ```solidity
    import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/KeeperCompatible.sol";

    contract LoanManager is KeeperCompatibleInterface {
        uint256 public repaymentDueDate;
        address public borrower;

        function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory) {
            upkeepNeeded = block.timestamp > repaymentDueDate; // Check if repayment is overdue
        }

        function performUpkeep(bytes calldata) external override {
            if (block.timestamp > repaymentDueDate) {
                // Trigger notification or update loan status
                notifyBorrower(borrower, "Repayment overdue");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Use Case**:
  - A borrower receives a reminder 3 days before the repayment is due.
  - If repayment is not made by the due date, the loan status is updated to “Defaulted” and collateral liquidation is triggered.

#### **3. Push Protocol: Notifications for Loan Updates**
- **Purpose**:
  - Send real-time notifications to borrowers and lenders about loan progress and key events.
  - Example notifications:
    - “Your repayment is due in 3 days.”
    - “Your collateral value has dropped below the required threshold.”

- **How It Works**:
  - Push Protocol’s SDK sends alerts triggered by Chainlink Keepers or portfolio updates.

- **Implementation**:
  - Example of sending notifications:
    ```javascript
    import { PushAPI } from '@push-protocol/sdk';

    async function notifyLoanProgress(userAddress, message) {
        await PushAPI.notifications.send({
            sender: 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS',
            recipient: userAddress,
            title: 'Loan Update',
            body: message,
        });
    }

    notifyLoanProgress(
        "0xUserAddress",
        "Your loan repayment is due in 3 days. Please ensure sufficient funds."
    );
    ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Borrowers receive reminders for upcoming payments.
  - Lenders are notified when repayments are credited to their wallets.

### **Detailed Workflow**

1. **Loan Status Updates**:
   - Loan status is tracked dynamically using **Chainlink Automation**.
   - Borrowers and lenders view the current status in the app:
     - Active loans show remaining balances and due dates.
     - Repaid loans are archived with a summary of repayment history.

2. **Collateral Value Monitoring**:
   - Crypto collateral:
     - Value updates dynamically via **1inch Portfolio API**.
     - Borrowers receive alerts if the value drops below the safe LTV ratio.
   - Tokenized real-world assets:
     - Collateral value changes are updated manually or based on periodic appraisals.

3. **Repayment Reminders**:
   - Chainlink Keepers trigger notifications for upcoming or overdue payments.
   - Borrowers receive automated reminders through **Push Protocol**.

4. **Interest and Payment Tracking**:
   - The system calculates interest and updates repayment amounts daily.
   - Lenders see repayments credited to their wallets and their overall return on investment.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Borrowers are alerted about:
     - Repayment deadlines.
     - Changes in collateral value.
   - Lenders are informed about:
     - Incoming repayments.
     - Collateral liquidation proceeds (if applicable).

### **Benefits of This Flow**

1. **Real-Time Insights**:
   - Borrowers and lenders can track loan performance and collateral value dynamically with 1inch Portfolio API.

2. **Automation**:
   - Chainlink Keepers reduce manual intervention by automating reminders and critical actions like status updates.

3. **Engagement**:
   - Push Protocol ensures borrowers and lenders stay informed, enhancing transparency and trust.

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Alerts for collateral value changes help borrowers avoid liquidation, while timely reminders ensure repayments.

### **Example Scenario**
1. Borrower pledges 1 ETH as collateral for a $1,500 loan.
2. **System Actions**:
   - Tracks ETH’s market value using 1inch Portfolio API.
   - Sends repayment reminders triggered by Chainlink Keepers.
   - Notifies borrowers if ETH’s value drops below the required LTV threshold.
3. Borrowers and lenders monitor loan progress, interest accrual, and repayment schedules in real time.
