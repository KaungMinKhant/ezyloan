1. **Loan Request Form**:
   - Borrowers access the loan request feature and provide:
     - **Loan Amount**: Desired loan value.
     - **Personal Information**: Age, Occupation, Monthly Income, Monthly Expense, Purpose of Loan.
     - **Collateral Type**:
       - **Crypto**: Deposit digital assets (e.g., ETH, USDC).
       - **Real-World Asset**: Items like gold, electronics, or vehicles are tokenized as NFTs.
     - **Loan Duration**: Specify the repayment period (e.g., 3, 6, or 12 months).
     - **Description of Real-World Asset**: Required for real-world tokenization.

2. **Real-World Asset Tokenization**:
   - Borrowers upload a description and proof of ownership (e.g., receipt, image).
   - Asset details are tokenized as **NFTs** and stored on the blockchain.
   - Asset verification is handled manually or using basic AI (e.g., image verification, document analysis).

3. **Collateral Valuation**:
   - **Crypto Collateral**:
     - Use Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch real-time token prices.
   - **Real-World Asset Collateral**:
     - Assign a mock value based on borrower-provided data or pre-defined categories (e.g., gold = $50/gram).

4. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**:
   - Calculate the maximum loan amount based on collateral value.
   - Example:
     - Crypto LTV: 70% of collateral value.
     - Real-World Asset LTV: 50% of tokenized asset value.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Borrowers are informed of their loan request status:
     - **Submitted**: Request is under review.
     - **Approved**: Loan amount and terms are shared.
     - **Rejected**: Reason for rejection is provided.

### **Integrations**

#### **1. Chainlink Price Feeds**
- **Purpose**:
  - Real-time valuation for crypto collateral.

- **Implementation**:
  ```solidity
  import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

  function getLatestPrice(address priceFeedAddress) public view returns (int) {
      AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeedAddress);
      (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
      return price;
  }
  ```
- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower pledges 1 ETH, and Chainlink fetches its price as $1,800.
  - Collateral value = $1,800, and max loan = $1,260 (70% LTV).

---

#### **2. Kinto: Fast and Low-Cost Tokenization**
- **Purpose**:
  - Tokenize real-world assets as NFTs and store them on-chain.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use Kinto SDK for Layer-2 NFT minting:
    ```javascript
    import { KintoSDK } from "kinto-sdk";

    const kinto = new KintoSDK();
    const nft = await kinto.mintNFT({
        metadata: {
            name: "Gold Bar",
            description: "24K Gold Bar, 100 grams",
            image: "https://example.com/gold-bar.jpg",
        },
    });
    console.log("NFT Tokenized:", nft.tokenId);
    ```
- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower submits proof of ownership for a 24K gold bar.
  - Kinto mints an NFT representing the asset and links it to the borrower’s wallet.

---

#### **3. Push Protocol: Notifications**
- **Purpose**:
  - Notify borrowers of loan request progress.
  - Examples:
    - “Your real-world asset has been tokenized successfully.”
    - “Your loan request has been approved!”

- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  import { PushAPI } from '@push-protocol/sdk';

  async function sendNotification(userAddress, message) {
      await PushAPI.notifications.send({
          sender: 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS',
          recipient: userAddress,
          title: 'Loan Request Update',
          body: message,
      });
  }

  sendNotification("0xUserAddress", "Your loan request for $5,000 has been approved!");
  ```

---

#### **4. Simplified Collateral Valuation for Real-World Assets**
- **Purpose**:
  - Mock asset valuation for the hackathon.

- **Implementation**:
  - Assign static or pre-defined values:
    ```javascript
    function evaluateRealWorldAsset(assetType, weightOrCondition) {
        const values = {
            gold: 50, // $50 per gram
            phone: 300, // $300 per phone
        };
        return values[assetType] * weightOrCondition;
    }

    console.log(evaluateRealWorldAsset("gold", 100)); // 100 grams of gold = $5,000
    ```
- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower submits a gold bar (100 grams).
  - System assigns a value of $5,000, with an LTV of 50% ($2,500 max loan).

---

### **Simplified Workflow for Hackathon**

#### **1. Borrower Loan Request Submission**
   - Borrower enters loan details, collateral type, and description of real-world assets.
   - Real-world assets are tokenized as NFTs using Kinto.

#### **2. Collateral Valuation**
   - **Crypto Collateral**:
     - Chainlink fetches real-time token prices.
   - **Real-World Collateral**:
     - Static or mock valuation for assets like gold or electronics.

#### **3. Loan Approval**
   - System calculates LTV and evaluates borrower reliability (basic credit scoring or mock scoring).
   - Borrowers receive loan status notifications via Push Protocol.
