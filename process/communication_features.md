### **Flow**:
1. **Direct Messaging**:
   - Borrowers and lenders can engage in real-time conversations for:
     - Negotiating loan terms (e.g., interest rate, repayment schedules).
     - Addressing questions or clarifications about the loan.
   - Conversations are private and secure.

2. **Video Calls**:
   - Borrowers and lenders can schedule or initiate video calls for:
     - High-stakes discussions or dispute resolutions.
     - Providing additional context for decisions (e.g., collateral verification).

3. **Notifications**:
   - Both parties receive notifications for:
     - New messages in the chat.
     - Scheduled or incoming video calls.

### **Integrations**

#### **1. Push Protocol Chat: Direct Messaging**
- **Purpose**:
  - Facilitate secure, decentralized messaging between borrowers and lenders.
  - Enable efficient communication without leaving the platform.

- **How It Works**:
  - Push Protocol Chat provides end-to-end encrypted messaging for Web3 applications.
  - Users can send and receive messages tied to their wallet addresses.

- **Implementation**:
  - Example of enabling Push Protocol Chat:
    ```javascript
    import { ChatAPI } from '@push-protocol/sdk';

    async function startChat(senderAddress, receiverAddress) {
        const chatInstance = await ChatAPI.startChat({
            sender: senderAddress,
            receiver: receiverAddress,
        });
        console.log("Chat started:", chatInstance);
    }

    async function sendMessage(chatId, message) {
        await ChatAPI.sendMessage({
            chatId: chatId,
            message: message,
        });
        console.log("Message sent:", message);
    }

    // Starting a chat
    startChat("0xBorrowerAddress", "0xLenderAddress");
    sendMessage("chat123", "Can we extend the repayment period?");
    ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower initiates a chat with the lender to request an extension on the repayment deadline.

#### **2. Push Protocol Video: Decentralized Video Calls**
- **Purpose**:
  - Facilitate face-to-face interactions between borrowers and lenders for important discussions or dispute resolution.
  - Provide a human touch to the loan process in a decentralized manner.

- **How It Works**:
  - Push Protocol Video integrates decentralized video conferencing directly into the platform.
  - Video calls are encrypted and private, ensuring secure communication.

- **Implementation**:
  - Example of scheduling and joining a video call:
    ```javascript
    import { VideoAPI } from '@push-protocol/sdk';

    async function scheduleCall(participants, time) {
        const callDetails = await VideoAPI.scheduleCall({
            participants: participants,
            time: time,
        });
        console.log("Video call scheduled:", callDetails);
    }

    async function joinCall(callId) {
        const callInstance = await VideoAPI.joinCall({
            callId: callId,
        });
        console.log("Joined video call:", callInstance);
    }

    // Scheduling a video call
    scheduleCall(["0xBorrowerAddress", "0xLenderAddress"], "2024-11-18T14:00:00Z");
    joinCall("call123");
    ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower and lender join a video call to discuss potential collateral adjustments due to market value fluctuations.

---

#### **3. Push Protocol Notifications**
- **Purpose**:
  - Keep borrowers and lenders informed about new messages or upcoming video calls.
  - Provide reminders to join scheduled calls or respond to messages.

- **How It Works**:
  - Push Protocol Notifications are triggered when:
    - A new chat message is received.
    - A video call is scheduled or about to start.

- **Implementation**:
  - Example of sending chat and call notifications:
    ```javascript
    import { PushAPI } from '@push-protocol/sdk';

    async function notifyNewMessage(receiverAddress, message) {
        await PushAPI.notifications.send({
            sender: 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS',
            recipient: receiverAddress,
            title: 'New Message',
            body: message,
        });
    }

    async function notifyVideoCall(receiverAddress, callTime) {
        await PushAPI.notifications.send({
            sender: 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS',
            recipient: receiverAddress,
            title: 'Upcoming Video Call',
            body: `You have a video call scheduled at ${callTime}.`,
        });
    }

    notifyNewMessage("0xLenderAddress", "The borrower has sent you a new message.");
    notifyVideoCall("0xBorrowerAddress", "2024-11-18 14:00 UTC");
    ```

- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower receives a notification: “Your lender has sent you a new message.”
  - Lender receives a reminder: “You have a video call scheduled in 15 minutes.”
