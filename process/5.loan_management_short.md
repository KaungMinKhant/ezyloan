### **Flow**

#### **1. Loan Status Tracking**
- Borrowers and lenders monitor:
  - Loan status: Active, Repaid, or Defaulted.
  - Loan balance and remaining repayment amount.
  - Due dates for upcoming payments.

#### **2. Collateral Value Tracking**
- Real-time updates for collateral value:
  - Crypto assets: Value tracked using real-time price feeds.
  - Tokenized real-world assets: Values updated manually or periodically.
- Alerts are generated if collateral value drops below the required Loan-to-Value (LTV) threshold.

#### **3. Interest Accrual**
- Dynamic calculation of interest based on:
  - Loan amount.
  - Repayment schedule.
- Borrowers view a detailed breakdown of the principal and interest in real time.

#### **4. Repayment Schedules**
- Borrowers:
  - Access repayment timelines, due dates, and total outstanding balances.
- Lenders:
  - Track repayment inflows and total returns.

#### **5. Notifications**
- Borrowers:
  - Receive reminders for repayment deadlines.
  - Get alerts for collateral value drops (e.g., liquidation warnings).
- Lenders:
  - Receive updates on repayments and collateral status.

### **Integrations**

#### **1. 1inch Portfolio API: Loan and Collateral Tracking**
- **Purpose**:
  - Dynamically track collateral value and loan-related portfolio performance.
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  const portfolio = await fetch(
    `https://api.1inch.io/v4.0/1/portfolio?wallet=${walletAddress}`
  );
  console.log("Portfolio Details:", portfolio);
  ```
- **Use Case**:
  - Borrower sees real-time updates on ETH collateral value.
  - Lender tracks loan inflows and interest earnings.

#### **2. Chainlink Automation (Keepers): Automated Loan Management**
- **Purpose**:
  - Automate key processes such as:
    - Updating loan statuses (Active, Repaid, or Defaulted).
    - Triggering repayment reminders.
    - Initiating collateral liquidation.
- **Implementation**:
  ```solidity
  import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/KeeperCompatible.sol";

  contract LoanManager is KeeperCompatibleInterface {
      uint256 public repaymentDueDate;

      function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory) {
          upkeepNeeded = block.timestamp > repaymentDueDate;
      }

      function performUpkeep(bytes calldata) external override {
          if (block.timestamp > repaymentDueDate) {
              // Trigger overdue repayment notification
              notifyBorrower("Your repayment is overdue.");
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- **Use Case**:
  - Borrowers are reminded 3 days before repayment is due.
  - If repayment is missed, the loan status changes to “Defaulted,” and liquidation begins.

---

#### **3. Push Protocol: Notifications**
- **Purpose**:
  - Send real-time notifications for critical loan events.
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  import { PushAPI } from '@push-protocol/sdk';

  async function notifyLoanProgress(userAddress, message) {
      await PushAPI.notifications.send({
          sender: 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ADDRESS',
          recipient: userAddress,
          title: 'Loan Update',
          body: message,
      });
  }

  notifyLoanProgress(
      "0xUserAddress",
      "Your repayment is due in 3 days. Please ensure sufficient funds."
  );
  ```
- **Use Case**:
  - Borrowers receive alerts for payment deadlines or collateral value drops.
  - Lenders are notified about successful repayments or liquidation proceeds.

---

### **Detailed Workflow**

#### **1. Loan Status Updates**
- Loan status (Active, Repaid, Defaulted) is dynamically updated using **Chainlink Keepers**.
- Borrowers and lenders track:
  - Loan balance and repayment progress.
  - History of past repayments for transparency.

#### **2. Collateral Monitoring**
- **Crypto Collateral**:
  - Value tracked using **1inch Portfolio API**.
  - Borrowers alerted when the value drops below the required LTV threshold.
- **Tokenized Real-World Assets**:
  - Value updated periodically or manually.

#### **3. Interest and Payment Updates**
- System calculates daily interest accrual.
- Borrowers view updated total repayment amounts, including interest.
- Lenders monitor repayment inflows and cumulative interest earnings.

#### **4. Repayment Reminders**
- **Chainlink Keepers** trigger automated reminders for upcoming and overdue repayments.
- Borrowers receive reminders 3 days before the due date.

#### **5. Notifications**
- Borrowers:
  - Alerts for repayment deadlines and collateral value changes.
- Lenders:
  - Updates on repayment inflows and loan statuses.

### **Benefits of This Refactored Process**

1. **Automation**:
   - Chainlink Keepers handle critical actions, reducing manual effort.

2. **Real-Time Tracking**:
   - 1inch Portfolio API ensures borrowers and lenders have up-to-date information.

3. **Engagement**:
   - Push Protocol notifications keep users informed, enhancing transparency.

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Alerts for collateral value drops minimize liquidation risks.
