#  Project Background

Have you ever faced‚Äîor heard of‚Äîchallenges in getting a loan, whether from a bank or a crypto exchange? For many, this is a frustrating reality.

Two persons - May (SME Business Owner) and April (Individual Lender with tangible proof of assets). 

May: She‚Äôs a small business owner with multiple assets, eager to expand her business. But her journey to secure a loan was far from easy. Traditional banks burdened her with endless paperwork and uncertainty. Crypto loans felt overwhelming due to her lack of expertise. Finally, she turned to informal lenders, exchanging assets for funds in a risky trust-based system. While she managed to get the loan, it came with unnecessary hardship & risks.

April: She's an individual lender with extra funds earning low interest in a savings account. While she sees potential in lending locally, she worrys about scams and defaults. 

**This kind of individual loan is popular in developing countries such as Myanmar.**

### **1. Wallet Creation and Management**
- Users can create and manage blockchain wallets directly through the platform.
- Wallets support multiple tokens, including ETH, USDC, and DAI.
- Wallet details, balances, and borrowed loans are displayed in a simple dashboard.

### **2. Loan Application for Borrowers**
- Borrowers can apply for loans using either crypto assets or tokenized real-world assets as collateral.
- Crypto Assets: Borrowers can pledge cryptocurrencies such as ETH or USDT as collateral.
- Real-World Assets: Borrowers pledge real world assets as colletary and system tokenize it to NFT in order to represent in digital realm.
- Loans are tied to specific collateral, with smart contracts managing the collateral and loan terms.

### **3. Lending Requests for Lenders**
- Lenders can create lending requests specifying the token they wish to lend, interest rates, and loan terms.
- Borrowers are matched with lenders based on token compatibility and available loan amounts.
- Lenders can accept repayment in different tokens through the platform's exchange mechanism.

### **4.Loan Repayment for Borrowers**
- Borrowers can repay loans partially or fully.
- Repayments can be made in tokens other than the loan token, with exchange rates calculated automatically.
- Smart contracts update loan statuses, reduce the loan amount, and release collateral upon full repayment.

### **5. Smart Contract Integration**
- Loans, collateral management, and repayments are handled via secure smart contracts.
- Smart contracts ensure transparency and automate processes like repayment validation and collateral release.

## How It‚Äôs Made

This project focuses on creating a decentralized peer to peer lending and borrowing platform with a clear emphasis on flexibility, transparency, and ease of use. Here's how the platform was built, reflecting only the components and technologies we actually implemented together:

---

### **Technologies Used**

1. **Frontend**
   - **Svelte**: Used for building a responsive and interactive user interface, including wallet management, loan application forms, and repayment workflows.
   - **Custom Styling**: Developed a clean and functional interface with lightweight custom CSS for a seamless user experience.

2. **Backend**
   - **FastAPI**: Served as the core backend framework for handling API requests, managing loan and repayment operations, and performing token-related logic.
   - **JSON Files**: Used as a lightweight, temporary data storage solution to prototype and test features like loan approvals and repayments.

3. **Blockchain Integrations**
   - **cdp-sdk**: The central library used for interacting with blockchain functionalities, including:
     - Wallet creation and management.
     - Token deployment and swapping.
     - Fund transfers between wallets.
   - **ERC-20 Smart Contracts**: Used to handle token-based transactions and ensure transparency for loan agreements and repayments.

4. **Exchange Rates**
   - **Custom API Implementation**: Built an exchange rate API that calculates the value of tokens using USD as a bridge, supporting flexible repayments in multiple tokens by leveraging **chainlink data feed**.

---

### **How Components Are Connected**

1. **Wallet Management**
   - Wallets are created using **cdp-sdk** and can also display balance information for tokens like ETH, USDC, and DAI.
   - Wallet data is dynamically fetched and displayed in a user-friendly dashboard.

2. **Loan Application and Approval**
   - Borrowers apply for loans by specifying the token type, collateral type, and amount.
   - Collateral and loan values are calculated based on custom exchange rate logic.
   - Lenders' offers are matched to borrowers based on token type and valuation using a custom algorithm.

3. **Loan Repayment**
   - Borrowers can repay loans flexibly in any supported token.
   - If the repayment token differs from the loan token, a swap is performed using **cdp-sdk**.
   - The smart contract is updated with repayment details, and the funds are transferred to the lender‚Äôs wallet.

4. **Smart Contracts**
   - Smart contracts (ERC-20) are deployed dynamically to manage loan terms.
   - Contracts track balances and ensure repayment updates are recorded on-chain for transparency.

---

### **Notable Hacks & Customizations**

1. **Dynamic Loan Matching**
   - Implemented a custom algorithm to prioritize matching based on the same token type, with fallback logic for cross-token conversions.

2. **Flexible Repayment Options**
   - Designed a repayment system that allows borrowers to pay in any supported token, using real-time exchange rates to calculate equivalent repayment amounts.

3. **Prototyping with JSON**
   - Prototyped key functionalities, like loan applications and repayments, using JSON files before scaling up with more complex integrations.

4. **Direct Blockchain Interactions**
   - Used **cdp-sdk** for essential blockchain operations, such as deploying tokens, executing trades, and transferring funds, without relying on third-party wallet providers or protocols.
